# Youtube-Comment-Scraping-and-Sentiment-Analysis
Scraping the Comments of any Youtube Video using the API key created using Google Cloud Console and performing Sentiment Analysis of those tweets.
## Usage
1) Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
2) Replace VIDEO_ID with the actual ID of the YouTube video from which you want to scrape comments.
3) Replace YOUR_API_KEY in the file with your actual Google Cloud API Key.
The script will fetch the comments from the specified YouTube video and perform sentiment analysis on them using TextBlob.

## Results
The sentiment analysis will classify each comment as positive, negative, or neutral. The results will be displayed in the console, and you can also customize the script to save the results to a file or visualize them.

## Notes
Respect YouTube's terms of service and API usage policies.
Sentiment analysis is not always 100% accurate and may require manual review for more accurate interpretation.
This is a basic implementation; you can enhance it by adding error handling, data visualization, or using more advanced sentiment analysis libraries.
